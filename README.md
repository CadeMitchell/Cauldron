# Cauldron

<p>This project is intended to make a tool that helps with making homebrew for use with 5eTools.<br>This is a project is its very early stage and is a WIP. This is my first personal project so don't roast my code too hard.</p>

<p>The current goal is to get a cmd based program made that can encompass all of the possible Homebrew you can add to the site. After the program is fully functional, I want to clean up my code and add an interface.</p>
